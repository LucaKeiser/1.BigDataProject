## Overview

Was the European Refugee Crisis accompanied by changes in the attitude towards immigrants in European Democracies?

This Notebook generates maps of European Countrys weighted towards several datasets. It displays

1) the changes of inflow of asylum seekers per 1000 inhabitants from the pre 2015 (i.e. 2000-2014) period to 2015

2) the change of a Migration-Index that illustrates the perception of immigrants per country. The average of 2002-2014 compared to the average of 2016 and 2018

3) the change in right-wing party election gains in official parliamentary elections from pre 2015 compared to 2015 or post 2015 per country.
